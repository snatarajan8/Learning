# Markdown tips and tricks

### Adding mathematical notation

Since there is no native support for TeX in markdown files in github, you have to get creative. Example -

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%7B%5Ccolor%7BGreen%7D%20w_0%20&plus;%20%5Csum%20_%7Bi%20%3D%201%7D%20%5E%7Bn%7D%20w_ix_i%7D)

You can change the color of the above text too, but I'm trying to figure out how to make it appear in a white box so you can use black. This and other ways to get TeX on github are [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35498525/latex-rendering-in-readme-md-on-github)

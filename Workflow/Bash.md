# Bash

Useful bash commands so I don't have to look at stack overflow to figure out what arguments I want for grep.\n

## Common commands

1. ls
	* List directory contents
	* ls [option(s)] [file(s)]
	* -a, -l are useful
2. echo
	* Prints text to the terminal window
	* echo [option(s)] [string(s)]
	* Useful in conjunction with > or >> to run something quickly

Problem 1B
----------
1 CPU = 67.7s
2 CPUs = 36.2s
4 CPUs = 33.4s

The relationship is not linear and begins to level off as we increase the number
of CPUs since the program can only be parallelized a certain amount and past that
number any additional CPUs do not make a difference.

Problem 2B
----------
The shortest time slices may not be ideal because of the large overhead with
multiple context switches and also large processes which maybe vital but take a
long time to execute are repeatedly pushed to the back of the ready queue and
are thereby delayed.

Problem 3B
----------
The static priority is the best approximation of SJF. It is impossible for SJF
to be implemented since there is no way to tell how long a CPU burst is going to
be. However the static priority algorithm uses priority, which can be used as a
heuristic to approximate the CPU burst time and hence be the most accurate
approximation of SJF.
